                                        The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever
                                        to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always
                                        suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lu-cid frankness.
                                        Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller's words,
                                        we should have shown him far less scepti- cism. For we should have perceived his motives;
                                        a pork butcher could understand Filby.
                                    </strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we
                                    distrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less clever man seemed
                                    tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who
                                    took him seri- ously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware
                                    that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with
                                    egg-shell china. So I don't think any of us said very much about time travelling in the
                                    interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt,
                                    in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious
                                    possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was
                                    particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remem- ber discussing with
                                    the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Lin- naean. He said he had seen a similar thing
                                    at Tubingen, and laid consid- erable stress on the blowing out of the candle. But how the
                                    trick was done he could not explain.

                                    The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and
                                    myself who had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank,
                                    the Editor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet,
                                    shy man with a beard—whom I didn't know, and who, as far as my observa- tion went,
                                    never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at the dinner-table
                                    about the Time Traveller's absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular
                                    spirit. The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden
                                    account of the 'ingenious paradox and trick' we had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst
                                    of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing
                                    the door, and saw it first. 'Hallo!' I said. 'At last!' And the door opened wider, and the Time
                                    Travel- ler stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. 'Good heavens! man, what's the matter?'
                                    cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.
                                    He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with green down the s
                                    leeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because
                                    its colour had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut
                                    half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by in- tense suffering. For a moment he
                                    hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.
                                    He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in si- lence,
                                    expecting him to speak.
